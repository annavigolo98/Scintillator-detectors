# scintillators
Programs to calculate the coincidences between two scintillator detectors given a time threshold and the peak of interest in the energy spectrum. Various methods to subtract the background: Fermi function, trapezoid, step function.
Program to subtract the overall background from an energy spectrum. Program to subtract the background of a peak with the Fermi function method by varying at random the extrema of the peak.
Program to make a fit of the yield profile used to calibrate the AN2000 accelerator with an arctangent function.
